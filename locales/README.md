# Translations
Welcome to `Terminal.ink`!
We're dedicated to making software accessable and open to greater audiences for free.

There are 3 Discord Nitro Classics (as of writing) up for grabs, for any of the following languages

`Arabic`, `Greek`, `Spanish`, `Estonian`, `Finnish`, `Fijian`, `Gaelic (Scottish)`, `Hindi`, `Italian`, `Japanese`, `Korean`, `Latin`, `Dutch`, `Norwegian`, `Portuguese`, `Russian`, `Swedish`, `Turkish`, `Vietnamese`, `Chinese (Simplified)`, `Chinese (Traditional)`

If a popular language is missing here, you may still be eligible.
Please ask a `sudoer` at [discord](https://discord.gg/DwBCgta) for information about translating ls.terminal.ink.

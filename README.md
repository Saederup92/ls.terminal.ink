Present your ideas in more than just English

### Multiprefix

Show how to trigger your bot, without the annoying guesswork of how to separate your multiple prefixes, and with tickboxes for "customisable" and "mentionable"

### Printable
You can print and mail your favorite bots to anyone around the world, with printouts that are optimised for printing instead of websites.
